# MSA2023-Software-Project

This project is part of the 2023 Microsoft Student Accelerator NZ Programme for Phase 2's software development pathway.

The deployed application from azure has been shut down, so the url to the application no longer worker. However, I plan to try re-deploy my application sometime in the near future via another service like netify.

Also, plan to include new branch for running the application on localhost.
